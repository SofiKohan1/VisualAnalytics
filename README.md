# VisualAnalytics
Visual Analytics Project for timeseries and unstructured data 

Task 1

  Part 1: Geospatial and Timeseries Data
The NOAA’s Global Historical Tsunami Database contains information about tsunamis recorded from 2100BC until today. The dataset presents 21 features and 2259 instances. Most data types encountered are objects, followed by float and a few integers. A dashboard presenting a generic overview of what the data represents has been developed to understand what characteristics are involved with tsunamis, and their evolution through history. Furthermore, graphs dedicated to specific characteristics are presented to gain a more in-depth insight. Finally, as the runup of a tsunami can be determined by magnitude and intensity values, plots are done to determine whether the registered values have any relationship when determining some other attribute (e.g., the total damage).

  Part 2: Unstructured Data
Most of the data produced nowadays are unstructured (e.g. images, videos, audio). For this reason, the type of data selected for the following section is audio data. The audio data to explore is provided by the VAST Challenge 2018 – Mini-challenge 1. The challenge provides audio files from different bird species and their corresponding calls. In addition, some other audio files have no bird species determined; these are known as the test audio files. Frequency analysis will be carried out throughout visualisations on the bird species audio files and test audio files. Once completed, it will be attempted to determine any similarities between the test files and the bird species files.

Task 2

  Part 1: Finding and evaluating and existing visual analytics approach
The VAST Challenge 2017 has been chosen to evaluate an existing visual Analytics Approach. The challenge provides a scenario and data for participants to explore, analyse, and build hypotheses with complex and/or linked data—in this case; the challenge addresses an environmental-related issue. A post-doc student studying ornithology has discovered that the rate of nesting pairs of Rose-Crested Blue Pipit bird is decreasing at worrying rates in Mistford. The student has gained access to several datasets to understand the circumstances.

  Part 2: Implementing parts of suggested approach
The dataset provided for the challenge is a .csv file containing data recorded by the sensors under the following data fields: timestamp, car-id, car-type and, gate-name data. An image with a map that contains the location of roadways and sensors in the park is also provided. Different types of cars with different road accesses and different types of sensors are also presented. It has been attempted to find at least three patterns of life presented using visualisations inspired by the solutions analysed.
